Run npm install, then ./dev/server to begin.

Quick, horrible demo: http://steveorsomethin.github.io/RefRend/index.html

The goal is to build a reference software renderer, not a fast production ready renderer. As such, a lot of code might be more generic than fast in the interest of just getting something working. Texture-mapping, lighting, z-buffers, and maybe even CPU-executed shaders are in the plan, even if they run at 1 fps.
